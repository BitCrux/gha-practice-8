      # GITHUB_TOKEN is a secret which is automatically generated by GitHub to avoid that anyone can send requests to this https://api.github.com/repos/.... API to edit or delte issues
      # GITHUB_TOKEN is used for request authentification and only valid as long as the jobs are running
      # Permissions are granted via GITHUB_TOKEN. If permissions are not assigned, automatic token authentication is used by default (attention!). doc: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication
      # Permissions can also be configured in GitHub -> Settings -> Actions
